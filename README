NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::ViewCode - View the source of the running
    application

SYNOPSIS
    In your CGI::Application based class

        use CGI::Application::Plugin::ViewCode;

    Then you can view your modules source as it's running by changing the
    url

        ?rm=view_code
        ?rm=view_code&line_no=1
        ?rm=view_code&module=CGI-Application

INTERFACE
    This plugin works by adding an extra run mode named `view_code' to the
    application. By calling this run mode you can see the source of the
    running module (by default) or you can specify which module you would
    like to view (see SECURITY).

    This extra run mode will accept the following arguments in the query
    string:

    module
        The name of the module to view. By default it is the module
        currently being run. Also, since colons (':') aren't simply typed
        into URL's, you can just substitute '-' for '::'.

            ?rm=view_code?module=My-Base-Class

    highlight
        Turn syntax highlighting (using Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved)
        on or off. By default it is 1 (on).

    line_no
        Turn viewing of line numbers on or off. By default it is 1 (on).

    pod Turn viewing of pod on or off. By default it is 1 (on).

SECURITY
    This plugin is designed to be used for development only. Please do not
    use it in a production system as it will allow anyone to see the source
    code for any loaded module. Consider yourself warned.
